# Bookmate
[Bookmate](https://bookme-prod-point.herokuapp.com/) is a simple backend application for Book Management. It is written with Flask-Restful in python.
It includes collection of APIs which dictate the
backend operations involved in this application's workflow. These APIs can be integrated in a frontend application to
either create a standalone book management project, or as a sub-application in a bigger project.
Please note this is just a basic hobby project and there is alot of scope of improvement in this project if it were to be used in production by
any chance.


Technologies used: 
- Flask-Restful
- Flask-JWT-Extended
- MongoEngine
